# Bandit Wargame - Level 13 -> Level 14

### Objective
The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. 

For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. 

Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on
