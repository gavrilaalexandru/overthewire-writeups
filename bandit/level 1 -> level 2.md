# Bandit Wargame - Level 1 -> Level 2

### Objective  
The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory.

‘-’ is a special symbol in Linux. So it is not recommended to start a file name with this symbol, ‘-’ being the standard option character.

First we make sure that the file is in the folder by using ls:

Using the command *cat -* does not return anything, so instead of using only the file name, let's try to add the absolute path of the file:
