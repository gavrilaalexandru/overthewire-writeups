# Bandit Wargame - Level 8 -> Level 9

### Objective  
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs only once

Like the last level, we only have a text file whose output we cannot display because it does not help us

But we know that the password is the only line of text that occurs only once, so `uniq` will be our best friend.

Before rushing and using `uniq` directly on the text file, we first have to sort it. (because uniq does not affect duplicate lines that are not consecutive)
